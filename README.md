 a simple bash script that will clear logs from typical log files on a Linux system. It will clear logs from the /var/log directory, which is where most system logs are stored.

This script will clear all logs in the /var/log directory
# Caution: Only run this if you are sure you want to clear all log files

```
git clone https://github.com/WhoamiGroot/Log-Killer
```

Steps to run the script:

    Save the script to a file, e.g., clear_logs.sh.
    
Make the script executable:
```
chmod +x clear_logs.sh
```
Run the script with root privileges (because accessing and clearing log files requires administrative permissions):
```
sudo ./clear_logs.sh
```
Important Notes:

    This script clears logs like system logs, authentication logs, and user logs.
    Clearing logs might be risky, especially for security or auditing purposes. Be cautious before running the script.
    This is designed for a typical Linux system using systemd. If you're using a different init system or logging tool, it may require adjustments.
